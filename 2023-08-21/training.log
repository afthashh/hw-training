Tried different methods without using scrapy and spider.
Successfully scraped data using parsel and saved the scraped data as a JSON file.
Experimented with using the requests library for data scraping.
Used cloudscraper along with parsel to scrape data from websites that implement anti-bot protection.
Used xpath selectors instead of css selectors for data extraction this time.
