# SCRAPY:
Scrapy is a powerful open-source Python framework designed specifically for web crawling and web scraping. 
 It provides developers with a robust set of tools and libraries to navigate websites, fetch data, and extract valuable information.


# Request:
A Request object represents an HTTP request that Scrapy sends to a website to retrieve web pages. It includes information such as the URL and optional callback function to handle the response.

# FormRequest:
A FormRequest is a specialized type of request that is used to submit forms on websites. It allows you to simulate form submissions by specifying form data and fields.

# Response:
A Response object represents the HTTP response received from a web page after sending a request. It contains the page content and various attributes for parsing.

# Shell and inspect_response:
Scrapy provides an interactive shell for testing and debugging. You can use the scrapy shell command to open a shell session and the inspect_response function to examine the response objects interactively.
eg:
scrapy shell 'https://example.com'
response
response.body  # View the page content
response.css('title::text').get()  # Extract data using CSS selectors

# Selector:
A Selector is a powerful tool within Scrapy to extract data from HTML or XML documents. It allows you to use XPath or CSS selectors to navigate and extract specific elements from the page.
